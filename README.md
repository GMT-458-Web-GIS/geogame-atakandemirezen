### Map Section :  There is a leaflet @OpenStreetMap map in the middle of our interface and our game is played on that screen.
### Answer Choices: Our players are given 4 answer choices and are asked to choose the correct one.
### Time Section  : Our player has exactly 100 seconds to answer the questions. However, each correct answer gives our player 2 seconds.
