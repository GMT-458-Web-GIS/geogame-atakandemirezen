# Score section  : 20 questions are asked to our players and their total score, each with 5 points, is written in the upper left corner. (Total score 100)
# Map Section : There is a leaflet @OpenStreetMap map in the middle of our interface and our game is played on that screen.
# Answer Choices: Our players are given 4 answer choices and are asked to choose the correct one.
# Time Section : Our player has exactly 100 seconds to answer 20 questions. However, each correct answer gives our player 2 seconds.
# Pause Section : If our player wants to stop the time, he can press the pause button. If he wants to start it again, he just presses the continue button.


## FUTURE PLANS

* One of the features I am currently working on is to bring a hard mode to the game. I am trying to bring a Hard mode (50 country estimate) for our players who are bored with the classic version of the game (20 country estimate) and want to move on to a more difficult stage.

* Restart button will be added

* Misunderstood countries will be introduced at the end of the game with visuals and information lines if desired.

* Interface will be developed
